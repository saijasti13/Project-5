                <h2>C Programming Language</h2>
                <p>Introduction to C........
                    C is a programming language developed at AT & T’s Bell Laboratories of USA in 1972. It was designed and written by a man named Dennis Ritchie. In the late
                   seventies C began to replace the more familiar languages of that time like PL/I,ALGOL, etc.ANSI C standard emerged in the early 1980s, this book was split into two
                   titles: The original was still called Programming in C, and the title that covered.ANSI C was called Programming in ANSI C. This was done because it took
                   several years for the compiler vendors to release their ANSI C compilers and for them to become ubiquitous. It was initially designed for programming UNIX
                   operating system. Now the software tool as well as the C compiler is written in C.Major parts of popular operating systems like Windows, UNIX, Linux is still
                   written in C. This is because even today when it comes to performance (speed of execution) nothing beats C. Moreover, if one is to extend the operating system to
                   work with new devices one needs to write device driver programs. These programs are exclusively written in C. C seems so popular is because it is reliable,
                   simple and easy to use. often heard today is – “C has been already superceded by languages like C++, C# and Java.

                        <p>Introduction to Python.......
                            Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
    
                            It is used for:
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>web development (server-side),</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>software development</strong></li>
                                <li><strong>mathematics</strong></li>
                                <li><Strong>system scripting.</strong></li>
                            </ul>
                            Python is a widely used general-purpose, high level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and further developed by the Python
                            Software Foundation. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of
                            code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major Python versions: Python 2
                            and Python 3.Both are quite different.Python 3 is a popular high-level programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Here are some basics
                            of Python 3 that you should know:
    
                            Variables: In Python 3, variables are created by assigning a value to a name. For example, x = 5 creates a variable called x and assigns the value 5 to it.
                            Data types: Python 3 supports several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
                            Operators: Python 3 supports a variety of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), and logical operators 
                            (and, or, not).
                            Control flow statements: Python 3 supports several control flow statements, including if-else statements, for loops, and while loops. 
                            These statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.
                            Functions: In Python 3, functions are created using the def keyword. For example, def my_function(x): creates a function called my_function that takes one
                            argument called x.
                        </p>

                                <p>Introduction to Java.......
                                    Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended 
                                    to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without
                                    the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. 
                                    Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
                                    JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language.
                                    Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented
                                    programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to
                                    write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on 
                                    any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to c/c++.

                                        <p>Introduction to C++.......
                                            C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include object-oriented paradigm. 
                                            It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application
                                            programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object
                                            -oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles.One of the key features of C++ 
                                            is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and 
                                            other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, 
                                            making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.
                                            C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language.
                                            Some of the key features of C++ include:
                                            Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods
                                            and properties for these objects.
                                            Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Web development (server-side),</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Software development</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematics</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>System scripting.</strong></li>
                </ul>
                Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. It was designed with an emphasis on code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express their concepts in fewer lines of code. Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently. There are two major Python versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Both are quite different. Python 3 is a popular high-level programming language used for a wide variety of applications. Here are some basics of Python 3 that you should know:

                Variables: In Python 3, variables are created by assigning a value to a name. For example, x = 5 creates a variable called x and assigns the value 5 to it.
                Data types: Python 3 supports several built-in data types, including integers, floats, strings, booleans, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.
                Operators: Python 3 supports a variety of operators, including arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators (>, <, ==, !=), and logical operators (and, or, not).
                Control flow statements: Python 3 supports several control flow statements, including if-else statements, for loops, and while loops. These statements allow you to control the flow of execution in your code.
                Functions: In Python 3, functions are created using the def keyword. For example, def my_function(x): creates a function called my_function that takes one argument called x.

            <h2>Java Programming Language</h2>
            <p>Introduction to Java.......
                Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers write once, and run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java was first released in 1995 and is widely used for developing applications for desktop, web, and mobile devices. Java is known for its simplicity, robustness, and security features, making it a popular choice for enterprise-level applications.
                Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in May 1995 and later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language.
                Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs. Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. A general-purpose programming language made for developers to write once run anywhere that is compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any Java Virtual Machine. The syntax of Java is similar to C/C++.

            <h2>C++ Programming Language</h2>
            <p>Introduction to C++.......
                C++ is a general-purpose programming language that was developed as an enhancement of the C language to include the object-oriented paradigm. It is an imperative and a compiled language. C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language designed for system and application programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs in 1983 as an extension of the C programming language. C++ is an object-oriented, multi-paradigm language that supports procedural, functional, and generic programming styles. One of the key features of C++ is its ability to support low-level, system-level programming, making it suitable for developing operating systems, device drivers, and other system software. At the same time, C++ also provides a rich set of libraries and features for high-level application programming, making it a popular choice for developing desktop applications, video games, and other complex applications.
                C++ has a large, active community of developers and users, and a wealth of resources and tools available for learning and using the language.
                Some of the key features of C++ include:
                Object-Oriented Programming: C++ supports object-oriented programming, allowing developers to create classes and objects and to define methods and properties for these objects.
                Templates: C++ templates allow developers to write generic code that can work with any data type, making it easier to write reusable and flexible code.
